Snakes on Medusa's head may act independently, just like modules in the project, but they are part of the single organism, and playing together, they create strong synergy.

  

#### Logo Structure

I think we need a separate small symbol that we can use as the tech icon, or favicon or in smaller spaces. The textual part and the symbol can be used together in horizontal and vertical alignment or as independent logos.

#### Textual part

I wanted to use the condensed font to make a more boxy shape.

I've adapted the Tulpen One google font by reshaping letters a bit and by adding small decorative elements in the form of the snakeheads

Textual pard has a strong rectangular silhouette and good readability black on white as well as inversion
